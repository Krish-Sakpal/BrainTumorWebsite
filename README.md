Anomaly Detection in Healthcare - Brain Tumor is a deep learning-based system designed to detect brain tumors from MRI scans. 
This project leverages Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) for anomaly detection, alongside Linear Regression for additional validation. 
The web application is built using Flask and features a modern UI with animations, enabling users to upload MRI scans for real-time tumor classification. 
The model is trained on the Kaggle Brain Tumor dataset, classifying images as either “Pituitary Tumor” or “No Tumor.”
